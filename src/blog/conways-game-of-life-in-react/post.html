<p>Here&#39;s a thing I made to learn React JS. It was my first take at implementing Conway&#39;s Game of Life, which I did without reading any other implementations. I haven&#39;t worked on it for months, but I&#39;m trying to get more things online instead of just deleting them.</p>
<p>When I stopped working on it, I was in the middle of trying to turn it into some kind of game, where you tried to get the cells to &#39;touch&#39; every part of the board. You can click on the board to make a cell alive for the next turn. Press space to pause the game, press s to step through the game one turn at a time and press r to restart the game with a random board.</p>
<p>If I were to refactor this, I would change the state to be a representation of the game state, instead of creating complicated cell object. Particularly shameful is how I&#39;m calculating neighbour cells.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t worked with React since, and a lot has happened. While I found their lack of documentation a little frustrating, I really enjoyed the way React enforces uniderectional data flow.</p>
